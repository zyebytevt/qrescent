# Qrescent Game Engine

This is the very first iteration of ZyeWare, which was conceived in 2019 for a physics assignment (as mentioned on [it's repository](https://github.com/zyebytevt/zyeware)).

The source code is not complete, what is in this repo is all I could find. I've uploaded it to this repository for archival purposes.

All occurrances of names that are personally identifiable have been replaced by ZyeByte.

The file `README_de.txt` contains the original text that I sent to my professor back then, additionally to the source code and everything else you're seeing in this repository.
A translated version of it exists as `README_en.txt`.
